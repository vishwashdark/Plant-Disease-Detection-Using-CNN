Detecting Plant Diseases at Scale: A Distributed
CNN Approach with PySpark and Hadoop


This project aims to assist farmers in detecting plant
diseases by capturing pictures of leaves and analyzing them
using advanced technologies. The approach utilizes Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) to train a model on the collected
leaf images. To efficiently handle large-scale data, Pyspark, a
Python library for distributed data processing, is employed. It
leverages the capabilities of the Hadoop environment to gather
and process the necessary data, ensuring access to the right
people for analysis. Additionally, the project incorporates Tkinter,
a graphical user interface (GUI) framework, to present the output
in an organized and user-friendly manner. The combined use of
CNN, Pyspark, and Tkinter enables accurate disease detection
and aids in providing timely solutions to help farmers effectively
manage plant health.
